# Sibonacci

Description
As is known to all, the definition of Fibonacci Numbers is: f(1)=1 f(2)=1 f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) (n>=3) Now Sempr found another Numbers, he named it "Sibonacci Numbers", the definition is below: f(x)=0 (x<0) f(x)=1 (0<=x<1) f(x)=f(x-1)+f(x-3.14) (x>=1) Your work is to tell me the result of f(x), is the answer is too large, divide it by 1000000007 and give me the remainder. Be careful the number x can be an integer or not.
Input
In the first line there is an Integer T(0<T<10000) which means the number of test cases in the input file. Then followed T different lines, each contains a number x(-1000<x<1000).
Output
For each case of the input file, just output the result, one for each line.
